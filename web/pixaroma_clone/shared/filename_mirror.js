// Browser MIRRORS of the Python filename pipeline, shared by every Pixaroma
// node that shows a live "Will save as" line.
//
// Extracted from js/save_image/state.mjs + js/save_image/index.js on 2026-08-10
// when Save Video Pixaroma was built. There must only ever be ONE copy: this
// mirror took three review rounds to get right, and a second copy would drift
// from the Python and from itself. The comments below ARE the record of those
// rounds - do not trim them.
//
// Keep in lockstep with nodes/_save_helpers.py (_expand_date_tokens,
// _safe_prefix, _sanitize_segment) and node_save_image.py (_expand_native_tokens).

// JS mirror of nodes/_save_helpers.py::_expand_date_tokens - ComfyUI-native
// %date:FMT% codes, case-sensitive, zero-padded to the token length, with
// H/HH kept as an hour alias and unknown runs (e.g. a lone 'yyy') literal.

// Display mirror of the Python sanitizer - keep in lockstep with _safe_prefix +
// _sanitize_segment in nodes/_save_helpers.py. Returns "" where Python returns
// None, so each caller supplies its OWN fallback (Save Image uses
// "image_%counter%", Save Video "Video_%counter%") rather than this function
// guessing which node called it.
//
// The "Will save as" line is the one thing these nodes tell users to trust, so
// every gap between the two sides is a lie about where their file goes. A first
// pass covered only some of the rules, and a review found the rest by running
// both sides on the same inputs. MEASURED disagreements, all fixed here (Python
// left, old preview right):
//     "/myfolder/name_%counter%"  image_001.png    myfolder\name_001.png
//     "../up/name_%counter%"      image_001.png    ..\up\name_001.png
//     "shot_%counter%."           shot_001.png     shot_001..png
//     "_%counter%"                001.png          _001.png
//     "%input%" unwired           image_001.png    .png
//
// Deliberately NOT mirrored, because the trigger is vanishingly narrow and each
// adds surface to this hot path: the Windows reserved-device-name suffix (a
// segment resolving to exactly CON/NUL/COM1/...), control characters inside a
// wired name, and the 256/100 char length caps.
//
// And one more, found in review round 3: the .trim() below is NOT a perfect
// stand-in for Python's str.strip(), because the two languages disagree on what
// counts as whitespace. JS trims U+FEFF and Python does not; Python strips
// U+0085 and \x1c-\x1f and JS does not. Since the trim now gates the reject
// tests, those characters at a pattern's very edge can flip the accept/reject
// decision in EITHER direction - e.g. "\uFEFF.." previews the fallback while the
// node really writes a file named "\uFEFF.png". Closing it means hand-rolling
// Python's isspace() class in a function that runs on every keystroke, which is
// more new surface than the bug is worth. Contained either way: this only
// affects the NAME inside an already-approved folder, never which folder is
// written to.
export function sanitizePrefixMirror(input) {
  // The leading .trim() mirrors _safe_prefix's `s.strip()`, and it has to come
  // BEFORE the two reject tests below, exactly as it does in Python. Without it
  // a single leading space smuggled a rejected pattern past both checks: " ..",
  // once split, is not === "..", and " /x" does not startsWith("/"), so the
  // per-segment loop quietly tidied the space away and the preview promised a
  // path the node would never write. MEASURED before the fix:
  //     " /secret"     node writes image_001.png   preview said secret.png
  //     " ../secret"   node writes image_001.png   preview said secret.png
  // Found in the second review round - the first round's fix was correct about
  // WHAT to reject and wrong about WHEN, which no amount of testing the
  // untrimmed inputs would have shown.

    // `name_%counter%_` so they can append a description, the shape core's own
    // SaveImage produces), while a leading one is nearly always the residue of
    // a token that resolved to nothing. Keep the two sides identical - a

    // lines promising paths the node would never write (save-image.md #21).
