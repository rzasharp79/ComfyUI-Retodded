// Defensive race-condition fix (issue #38 family): rapid pick-A-then-B picks

/**
 * Point ComfyUI's OWN per-node picture store at the file we just picked.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-10, from a Load Image Mini report ("still the wrong image")
 * with a screen recording: pick a new file, switch workflow tab, come back, and
 * the picker names the new file while the preview and the INPUT size card show
 * the OLD one.
 *
 * ComfyUI keeps a picture per node id in `app.nodeOutputs`. On a workflow
 * restore it replays that entry as a preview load AT THE SAME TIME as the load
 * the restored widget value triggers - two async fetches writing the same
 * `node.imgs`, so the one that finishes LAST wins. Core's native image combo
 * writes this store on every commit (its callback is
 * `node.imgs = undefined; setNodeOutputs(node, widget.value); ...`), so for a
 * native LoadImage both loads name the same file and the race cannot be seen.
 * Our DOM picker wrote only the widget, so the store kept naming the PREVIOUS
 * file and the two loads genuinely disagreed. Measured on real picks: the stale
 * load landed 3ms AFTER the correct one in one run and 3ms BEFORE it in
 * another - which is why the report was intermittent and why a quick retest
 * "looked fixed".
 *
 * Losing that race is not cosmetic: `node.imgs` also feeds the INPUT size card
 * and is what Mask Editor and Clipspace read, so the node reports the wrong
 * dimensions for the file it names, and a mask would be taken against the wrong
 * picture.
 *
 * Same shape as `notifyGraphChanged` below: a native widget quietly updates a
 * piece of core state that a DOM control has to update by hand. Keeping the
 * store in step removes the stale load at its source rather than trying to win
 * a race (verified: with this, core's two loads name the same file, exactly as
 * they do for its own LoadImage).

/**
 * Put the picture back after an EXTERNAL write left the node blank.
 *
 * MEASURED on frontend 1.47.12 in the CLASSIC renderer, from a user report that
 * "Copy/Paste (Clipspace) is not working" on both loaders. Instrumenting every
 * `node.imgs` write across one paste gives the whole story in three lines:
 *
 *   pasteFromClipspace   node.imgs = [the pasted picture]
 *   m.callback           node.imgs = undefined
 *   (nothing, ever)
 *
 * Core's paste assigns the picture, then fires the image widget's own callback,
 * whose first act is `node.imgs = undefined` before it re-derives the preview
 * from `app.nodeOutputs`. That re-derive is `syncLegacyNodeImgs`, and its first
 * line is `if (!vueNodesMode) return` - so in Classic nothing ever repopulates
 * it and the node is left naming the pasted file with no picture at all. It is
 * NOT our bug: ComfyUI's own LoadImage does exactly the same thing on the same
 * paste (verified with a real right-click, both directions), and in Nodes 2.0
 * both nodes are fine. We repair it anyway because the report lands on us, and
 * because a blank preview here is not cosmetic - `node.imgs` feeds the INPUT
 * size card and is what Mask Editor and a later Copy (Clipspace) read.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, since it rides the widget-value setter that fires on
 * EVERY write:
 *   - `_rpcLiPreviewReqId` unchanged since the write == none of our own pick
 *     paths started a fetch, so a normal pick never double-fetches (they write
 *     the value and THEN call updateNativePreview, which bumps the id).
 *   - `previewMatches` == the right picture is already loaded, so a paste whose
 *     source carried no `image` widget (a Save Image node: no callback fires, so
 *     core's own assignment survives) and the Mask Editor are left alone.
 *     MEASURED: this does NOT make us a no-op in Nodes 2.0 - core clears
 *     `node.imgs` there too, so at +0ms there is nothing to match and we fetch
 *     as well. Both fetches name the same file, so the picture is right either
 *     way; the cost is one extra local request per paste, and the benefit is
 *     that a regression in core's Nodes-2.0 repopulate cannot blank our nodes.
 *   - Never on the load path: node SETUP already reconciles the preview there,
 *     and the load path is the one place a stray write does damage.
 * A 0ms timer is enough because core's whole paste is synchronous; the measured
 * trace shows no further `node.imgs` write for at least 3 seconds after it.
